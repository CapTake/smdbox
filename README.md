# SMD BOX

Smd box is tool for displaying SMD schema of RPC services 

## Getting started

* Run:
    * `yarn run dev` — watches the project with continuous rebuild at localhost:4500
    * `yarn run prod` — builds minified project for production
    * `yarn run dist` — same as 'prod', but assets are made without hash (e.g. for deploys from github)
    * `yarn run clean` — clean production assets
    * `node index` - runs test smd schema server on localhost:8082/test (use as smd url in settings)
